\section{Introduction}

Fast pyrolysis is a versatile method for thermochemical conversion of solid biomass into liquid bio-oil which can be used for bio-fuel and high-value chemical production. Several reactor types have been used for pyrolysis such as entrained flow, bubbling fluidized bed, fixed bed, auger, circulating fluidized bed, ablative, and spouted bed reactors \cite{Uddin-2018, Bridgwater-1991}. However, bio-oil derived from biomass feedstock is commonly generated in bubbling fluidized bed and circulating fluidized bed reactor systems in which biomass particles rapidly devolatilize in the absence of oxygen into mixtures of light gases, condensable bio-oil vapors, and solid char \cite{Bridgwater-1999, Bridgwater-2018a, Mohan-2006}. Since biomass pyrolysis normally occurs in a non-oxidizing environment, the fluidization gas (carrier gas) is often pure nitrogen \cite{Mohan-2006}. To maximize bio-oil yields, the reactor typically operates at temperatures near 500$^\circ$C and must maintain particle residence times up to 10 seconds and gas residence times less than 2 seconds \cite{Bridgwater-2018a}. Deviations from these conditions can result in significant production and quality penalties; therefore, optimal reactor design and control become crucial to achieving commercially viable bio-oil production.

To improve the economic feasibility of biomass fast pyrolysis systems, char can be burned for process heat while recycled pyrolysis gas can assist with fluidization \cite{Bridgwater-1999, Mante-2012, Elkasabi-2015}. The major generated components of pyrolysis gas are CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$, along with other light hydrocarbons \cite{Asadullah-2008, Zhang-2011}. Experiments conducted by Mante et al. noticed increased liquid yields and decreased char/coke yields from fluidizing gas mixtures of CO/N$_2$, CO$_2$/N$_2$, CO/CO$_2$/N$_2$, and H$_2$/N$_2$ \cite{Mante-2012}. Mullen et al. recycled CO, CO$_2$, H$_2$ to create a reduced atmosphere in the reactor and saw deoxygenation effects on the pyrolysis oil along with lower total acid numbers and higher energy content \cite{Mullen-2013}. Zhang et al. investigated N$_2$, CO$_2$, CO, CH$_4$, and H$_2$ carrier gases and reported improved bio-oil heating value when using CO and H$_2$ as the carrier gas \cite{Zhang-2011}. Experiments by Elkasabi et al. recycled the non-condensable pyrolysis gas stream into the fluidized bed and noticed bio-oil with lower oxygen content and higher hydrocarbons compared to traditional bio-oil from an all nitrogen environment \cite{Elkasabi-2015}. Consequently, several experiments have studied the effects of different fluidization gases on pyrolysis yields but modeling these effects was not discussed in the reported literature.

Autothermal pyrolysis experiments in a fluidized bed reactor has shown that the presence of oxygen in the carrier gas can prevent reactor clogging by reducing char formation \cite{Kim-2014}. The addition of oxygen can also improve heat transfer within the reactor via partial oxidiation of the pyrolysis products without significant decreases in bio-oil yield \cite{Polin-2019a, Oyedeji-2022}. Substituting air for nitrogen gas allowed for higher superficial velocities which promoted elutriation of char from reactor experiments while having neglible effect on bio-oil yield \cite{Polin-2019b}. Modeling the fluidization behavior inside the reactor at autothermal pyrolysis conditions was not discussed in the available literature.

There are several fluidized bed reactor models that investigate the hydrodynamics and conversion of biomass at fast pyrolysis conditions \cite{Papadikis-2009, Papadikis-2010, Mellin-2014, Xiong-2016, Xue-2011}. These models assume the carrier gas is pure nitrogen which is a typical scenario for biomass fast pyrolysis. We are not aware of any models in the biomass pyrolysis literature that investigate the effects of a carrier gas other than pure nitrogen. Consequently, our objective in this paper is to evaluate different fluidization gases and their effects on the hydrodynamics and biomass conversion in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor operating at fast pyrolysis conditions. Modeling the effects on the pyrolysis reaction chemistry is not possible because current kinetic schemes for biomass pyrolysis do not account for carrier gas properties. Our methodology uses engineering correlations, reducing-order modeling techniques, and CFD simulations to model these effects and compare the model results (where applicable) to experimental data.

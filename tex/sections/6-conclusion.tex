\section{Conclusion}

Gas effects in a fluidized bed biomass pyrolysis reactor using engineering correlations, low-order models, and CFD simulations were investigated for N2, H2, H2O, CO, CO2, and CH4 carrier gas mixtures. Our findings reveal viscosity of a gas mixture can be significantly underestimated depending on the model. Furthermore, fluidization characteristics such as U$_\text{mf}$ are greatly affected by gas properties but the effect on biomass pyrolysis yields is negligible.

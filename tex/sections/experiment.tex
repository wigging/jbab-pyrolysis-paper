\section{Experimental apparatus}

The NREL 2FBR reactor system thermochemically converts biomass feedstock at fast pyrolysis conditions. The system is comprised of two bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactors where the first reactor is a biomass fast pyrolysis unit (also known as the ``pyrolyzer'') and the second reactor is for vapor phase upgrading. An overview of the components and inlet/outlet flows of the NREL 2FBR pyrolysis unit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pyrolyzer-components}, while dimensions and typical operating conditions of the pyrolysis reactor are detailed in Figure \ref{fig:pyrolyzer-dims-flows}. Sand along with the carrier gas is used as the fluidization medium in the pyrolyzer while biomass particles are fed to the reactor via a screw auger. More information about the NREL 2FBR biomass pyrolysis system is available elsewhere \cite{Howe-2015, Trendewicz-2015}. Yields from the BFB pyrolysis reactor are compared to model results discussed later in this paper.

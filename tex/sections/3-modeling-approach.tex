\section{Modeling approach}

Our strategy to model gas effects in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor begins with determining gas properties such as density, dynamic viscosity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity. Once the individual gas viscosity is known, the viscosity of a gas mixture is calculated using various mixture models. Next, fluidization correlations relevant to fluidized bed reactors are used to investigate the effects of the gas properties on the hydrodynamics of the system. Dimensionless numbers provide insight on the limiting mechanisms in regards to the pyrolysis of the biomass particles. Finally, CFD-DEM simulations provide residence times and product yields related to the different carrier gas properties.

\subsection{Gas properties}

Gas density is calculated using the ideal gas law as shown in Equation \ref{eq:density} where $\rho_\text{gas}$ is density (kg/m$^3$), P is pressure (Pa), M is molecular weight (g/mol), R is the gas constant (m$^3\cdot$Pa / K$\cdot$mol), and T is temperature (K).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:density}
    \rho_\text{gas} = \frac{P\,M}{R\,T}
\end{equation}

Dynamic gas viscosity $\mu_\text{gas}$ is estimated by Equation \ref{eq:viscosity} in units of \textmugreek P. Gas thermal conductivity k$_\text{gas}$ as W/m$\cdot$K is calculated from Equation \ref{eq:thermlcond} and heat capacity C$_\text{p\,gas}$ as J/mol$\cdot$K is determined using Equation \ref{eq:heatcap}. In each equation, temperature is denoted by T in units of Kelvin while the regression coefficients A, B, C, D, E, F, and G for a particular gas were obtained from Yaws' Handbook \cite{Yaws2014}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:viscosity}
    \mu_\text{gas} = A + B\,T + C\,T^2 + D\,T^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:thermlcond}
    k_\text{gas} = A + B\,T + C\,T^2 + D\,T^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:heatcap}
    C_\text{p\,gas} = A + B\,T + C\,T^2 + D\,T^3 + E\,T^4 + F\,T^5 + G\,T^6
\end{equation}

Several methods are available to calculate the dynamic viscosity of a gas mixture. The simplest approach is Graham's model in Equation \ref{eq:graham} which sums the gas viscosities $\mu_\text{i}$ and mole fractions x$_\text{i}$ of each gas component \cite{Graham-1846}.

\begin{equation}
    \mu_\text{mix} = \sum(x_i \; \mu_i)
    \label{eq:graham}
\end{equation}

\noindent The Herning and Zipperer approach shown by Equation \ref{eq:herning}, sums the viscosities weighted by the square root of the molecular weight M$_\text{i}$ for each component \cite{Herning-1936}. According to Davidson's report \cite{Davidson-1993}, the Herning and Zipperer model is not recommended for gas mixtures containing significant amounts of hydrogen.

\begin{equation}
    \mu_\text{mix} = \sum \frac{\mu_i \; x_i \; \sqrt{M_i}}{x_i \; \sqrt{M_i}}
    \label{eq:herning}
\end{equation}

\noindent Wilke's model represented by Equations \ref{eq:wilke-phi} and \ref{eq:wilke-mu} is based on a kinetic theory implementation which requires a coefficient $\phi_\text{ij}$ for each gas component \cite{Wilke-1950}. The coefficients are used along with the mole fractions to calculate the overall mixture viscosity.

\begin{align}
    \phi_{ij} &= \frac{\left[1 + (\mu_i/\mu_j)^{1/2} (M_j/M_i)^{1/4}\right]^2}{(4/\sqrt{2}) \left[1 + (M_i/M_j)\right]^{1/2}} \label{eq:wilke-phi} \\
    \mu_{\text{mix}} &= \sum_{i=1} \frac{\mu_i}{1 + \frac{1}{x_i} \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\j \neq i}} x_j \, \phi_{ij}} \label{eq:wilke-mu}
\end{align}

\noindent Brokaw provides a model for nonpolar and polar gas mixtures that utilizes the viscosities, molecular weights, and mole fractions of the mixture components \cite{Brokaw-1968}. The molecular weight ratios of the gas components are described by Equations \ref{eq:brokaw-mij} and \ref{eq:brokaw-aij}; the ratios are used in Equation \ref{eq:brokaw-mu} to calculate the overall mixture viscosity where S$_\text{ij} = 1$ for nonpolar gases.

\begin{align}
    m_{ij} &= \left[ 4 M_i M_j / (M_i + M_j)^2 \right]^{1/4} \label{eq:brokaw-mij} \\
    A_{ij} &= m_{ij}\left( \frac{M_j}{M_i} \right)^{1/2} \left[ 1 + \frac{\frac{M_i}{M_j} - \left(\frac{M_i}{M_j} \right)^{0.45} }{ 2 \left(1 + \frac{M_i}{M_j} \right) + \frac{1 + \left(\frac{M_i}{M_j} \right)^{0.45}}{1 + m_{ij}} m_{ij}} \right] \label{eq:brokaw-aij} \\
    \mu_{\text{mix}} &= \sum_{i=1} \frac{x_i \sqrt{\mu_i}}{\frac{x_i}{\sqrt{\mu_i}} + \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j \neq i}} \frac{S_{ij} \, A_{ij}}{\sqrt{\mu_j}} x_j} \label{eq:brokaw-mu}
\end{align}

\noindent Lastly, the approach by Davidson estimates viscosity in terms of the fluidity of the gas mixture \cite{Davidson-1993}. This method utilizes the momentum efficiency of the gas components to predict the mixture fluidity which is the reciprocal of the gas viscosity as given by Equations \ref{eq:davidson-eij}, \ref{eq:davidson-f}, and \ref{eq:davidson-mu} respectively. The empirical constant A was calculated as 0.375 using reported viscosities of 35 gas pairs \cite{Davidson-1993}.

\begin{align}
    E_{ij} &= \frac{2 \sqrt{M_i\, M_j}}{M_i + M_j} \label{eq:davidson-eij} \\
    f &= \sum \frac{x_i\, x_j}{\sqrt{\mu_i\, \mu_j}} E_{ij}^A \label{eq:davidson-f} \\
    \mu_\text{mix} &= 1 / f \label{eq:davidson-mu}
\end{align}

\subsection{Fluidization correlations}

For a bed of particles, the minimum fluidization velocity U$_\text{mf}$ is the gas velocity at which the drag force of the upward moving gas equals the weight of the particles. Kunii and Levenspiel \cite{Levenspiel-1991} provide the following equation for calculating minimum fluidization velocity

\begin{equation}
    U_\text{mf} = \frac{Re_\text{p,mf}\; \mu}{d_p\, \rho_g}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mu$ is gas viscosity (kg/m$\cdot$s), d$_\text{p}$ is particle diameter (m), $\rho_\text{g}$ is gas density (kg/m$^3$), and Re$_\text{p,mf}$ is the particle Reynolds number at minimum fluidization conditions. The Reynolds number is calculated using the Archimedes number (Ar) as follows

\begin{align}
    Re_{p,mf} &= \left( a^2 + b Ar \right)^{1/2} - a \\
    Ar &= \frac{d_p^3 \rho_g (\rho_s - \rho_g) g}{\mu^2}
\end{align}

\noindent where a and b are dimensionless constants which represent experimental coefficients. Some U$_\text{mf}$ correlations in the literature are based on experimental data from Wen and Yu where a, b = 33.7, 0.0408; from Richardson where a, b = 25.7, 0.0365; and from Grace where a, b = 27.2, 0.0408 \cite{Levenspiel-1991}. However, Kunii and Levenspiel \cite{Levenspiel-1991} suggest the constants ($a, b$) can be derived from the Ergun pressure drop equation based on constants K$_1$ and K$_2$ where $\epsilon_\text{mf}$ is the bed void fraction at minimum fluidization and $\phi$ is sphericity of the bed particles. For this paper, U$_\text{mf}$ is estimated based on the Ergun, Grace, Richardson, and Wen and Yu correlations.

\begin{equation}
    a = \frac{K_2}{2 K_1} \qquad
    b = \frac{1}{K_1}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    K_1 = \frac{1.75}{\epsilon_{mf}^3 \phi} \qquad
    K_2 = \frac{150(1-\epsilon_{mf})}{\epsilon_{mf}^3 \phi^2}
\end{equation}

The terminal velocity U$_\text{t}$ of a particle is the minimum gas velocity to entrain a particle of size d$_\text{p}$. This velocity can be estimated from the maximum velocity of a particle in free-fall through a fluid, which is given by Equation \ref{eq:terminal}. Here, Re$_\text{p}$ is the particle Reynolds number given by Equation \ref{eq:particleRe} and C$_\text{D}$ is the drag coefficient which was estimated from an emperical correlation developed by Haider and Levenspiel \cite{haider1989drag} and given by Equation \ref{eq:dragCoeff}.

\begin{align}
    U_{t} &= \left [\frac{4d_{p} \left (\rho_{s}-\rho_{g} \right )g}{3\rho_{g}C_{D}}\right ]^{1/2} \label{eq:terminal} \\
    Re_{p} &= \frac{d_{p}U_{t}\rho_{g}}{\mu_{g}} \label{eq:particleRe} \\
    C_{D} &= \frac{24}{Re_{p}}\left [ 1+\left ( 8.1716e^{-4.0655\phi } \right )Re_{p}^{0.0964+0.5565\phi} \right ]+\frac{73.69Re_{p}e^{-5.0748\phi}}{Re_{p}+5.378e^{6.2122\phi}} \label{eq:dragCoeff}
\end{align}

% based on results, it looks like h is a function of Umf and not U, so this was changed back
As shown in Equation \ref{eq:nusselt}, the convective heat transfer coefficient h in units of W/m$^2$K can be determined from the Nusselt number Nu where Re is the Reynolds number, d$_\text{p}$ is the biomass particle diameter, d$_\text{b}$ is the sand particle diameter, and k$_\text{g}$ is the gas thermal conductivity. According to Collier et al. \cite{Collier-2004}, this approach is valid for $\text{d}_\text{p} < \text{d}_\text{b}$. The Reynolds number was determined from the gas density $\rho$ (kg/m$^3$), the minimum fluidization velocity U$_\text{mf}$ (m/s), and the dynamic gas viscosity $\mu$ (kg/m$\cdot$s) \cite{Papadikis-2010}.

\begin{align}
    Nu &= 2 + 0.9\, Re^{0.62} \left(\frac{d_p}{d_b}\right)^{0.2} = \frac{h\, d_p}{k_g} \label{eq:nusselt} \\
    Re &= \frac{\rho\, U_{mf}\, d_p}{\mu}
\end{align}

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Dimensionless numbers}

As mentioned in the work of Pyle and Zaror \cite{Pyle-1984}, the rate of pyrolysis involves a balance between internal and external heat transfer due to heat transport and reaction. This balance is embodied by the dimensionless numbers Bi, Py$^\text{I}$, and Py$^\text{II}$ which are determined from Equations \ref{eq:biot}, \ref{eq:pynumber1}, and \ref{eq:pynumber2} respectively. The Biot number Bi represents the ratio of convective and conductive heat transport. The first pyrolysis number Py$^\text{I}$ demonstrates the ratio of heat transfer by conduction to the rate of heat loss due to products leaving the particle. The second pyrolysis number Py$^\text{II}$ is the effect of convective heat transfer to the external particle surface relative to the reaction heat loss. The Biot and pyrolysis numbers are calculated using the following parameters: h is the convective heat transfer coefficient (W/m$^2$K), R is the radius or characteristic length of the biomass particle (m), k is the biomass thermal conductivity (W/m$\cdot$K), $\rho$ is the density of the biomass particle (kg/m$^3$), K is the total rate constant in 1/s for the primary reactions, and C$_\text{p}$ is the biomass heat capacity calculated from $103.1 + 3.867\,\text{T}$ where T is the biomass temperature in Kelvin.

\begin{align}
    Bi &= \frac{h\,R}{k} \label{eq:biot} \\
    Py^{\textrm{I}} &= \frac{k}{\rho\,C_p\,R^2\,K} \label{eq:pynumber1} \\
    Py^{\textrm{II}} &= \frac{h}{\rho\,C_p\,R\,K} \label{eq:pynumber2}
\end{align}

The Prandtl number is a dimensionless number representing the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. It is calculated from the equation shown below where C$_\text{p}$ is heat capacity (J/kg$\cdot$K), $\mu$ is dynamic gas viscosity (kg/m$\cdot$s), and k is thermal conductivity (W/m$\cdot$K).

\begin{equation}
    Pr = \frac{C_p\, \mu}{k}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Biomass pyrolysis kinetics}

A pyrolysis kinetics scheme based on the work of Di Blasi was implemented to predict the conversion of biomass into gas, tar, and char products \cite{Blasi-1993,Blasi-2001}. Figure \ref{fig:blasi} gives an overview of the scheme and its reaction mechanisms. Reactions 1--3 represent the primary conversion of biomass while reactions 4--5 are secondary reactions that reduce tar yield at long residence times. Reaction 6 is the conversion of moisture in the biomass to water vapor.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{kinetics.pdf}
    \caption{Diagram of the Di Blasi pyrolysis kinetics scheme for conversion of biomass to gas, tar, and char products.}
    \label{fig:blasi}
\end{figure}

The pyrolysis reactions were modeled as first-order Arrhenius type equations where the reaction rate is given as

\begin{equation}
    r_i = C_i\,A_i\,e^{-E_i / R\,T}
\end{equation}

\noindent where r$_\text{i}$ is the rate of reaction i such that C$_\text{i}$ is a mass based concentration, A$_\text{i}$ is the pre-factor (1/s), E$_\text{i}$ is the activation energy (kJ/mol), R is the gas constant, and T is the reaction temperature (K). Kinetic parameters for each reaction are listed in Table \ref{tab:kinetic-params} where $\Delta$H is the heat of reaction (kJ/kg). Based on the work performed by Lu et al.\cite{lu2020bridging}, the Di Blasi kinetics overpredict light gas production when using a coarse-grained DEM model. Consequently, we adjusted the pre-factor of reaction 4 by a factor of 0.2 which was determined by comparisons with NREL experiments.

\subsection{CFD-DEM simulation}

A coarse-grained CFD-DEM model was implemented for biomass pyrolysis in MFiX, an open-source, Fortran-based code \cite{Syamlal-1993}. The coarse-grained CFD-DEM model used in this work is an extension of the standard MFiX release. Gas phase transport was described using conservation equations of mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species in the Eulerian framework (Equations \ref{eq:gas-trans-mass}--\ref{eq:gas-trans-chemical}, respectively).

\begin{align}
    \frac{d(\epsilon_g \rho_g)}{dt} + \nabla (\epsilon_g \rho_g u_g) &= S_\rho \label{eq:gas-trans-mass} \\
    \frac{d(\epsilon_g \rho_g u_g)}{dt} + \nabla (\epsilon_g \rho_g u_g u_g) &= -\epsilon_g \nabla p + \nabla (\epsilon_g \tau) + \epsilon_g \rho_g g + S_u \\
    \frac{d(\epsilon_g \rho_g E)}{dt} + \nabla (\epsilon_g \rho_g u_g E) &= -\nabla Q + S_E \\
    \frac{d(\epsilon_g \rho_g Y_i)}{dt} + \nabla (\epsilon_g \rho_g u_g Y_i) &= -\nabla (D_i \nabla Y_i) + S_{Y_i} \label{eq:gas-trans-chemical}
\end{align}

\noindent where $\epsilon_\text{g}$, $\rho_\text{g}$, u$_\text{g}$, p, $\tau$, Q, and Y$_\text{i}$ are gas phase volume fraction, density, velocity, pressure, stress tensor, conductive heat flux, and ith chemical species, respectively; while t is time, g is acceleration due to gravity, D$_\text{i}$ is mass diffusion coefficient for species, S$_\rho$, S$_\text{u}$, S$_\text{E}$, and S$_\text{Yi}$ are mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species source terms, respectively.

Fixed quantities of discrete particles with identical initial conditions were lumped into a computational coarse-grained parcel (CGP), whose motion was governed by Newton’s second law of motion. All particle forces and contact dynamics were calculated on the parcel scale, whereas heat and mass transfers were calculated on particle scale and projected to the entire parcel. Accordingly, all particles in same coarse-grained parcel possess identical temperature, chemical species concentration, and momentum. The mass and diameter of each coarse-grained parcel is such that

\begin{align}
    m_{CGP} &= m_p W \\
    d_{CGP} &= d_p W^{1/3}
\end{align}

\noindent where m$_\text{CGP}$ is CGP mass, m$_\text{p}$ is distinct particle mass, W parcel statistical weight, d$_\text{CGP}$ is CGP diameter, and d$_\text{p}$ is distinct particle diameter. Instantaneous accelerations (translational and rotational) for each coarse-grained parcel were calculated as

\begin{align}
    \frac{d u_{CGP}}{dt} &= g - \frac{F_p}{m_{CGP}} + \frac{F_c}{m_{CGP}} + \frac{F_d}{m_{CGP}} \\
    \frac{d \omega_{CGP}}{dt} &= \frac{T_{CGP}}{I_{CGP}}
\end{align}

\noindent where u$_\text{CGP}$ and $\omega_\text{CGP}$ are the CGP translational and rotational velocities, g is acceleration due to gravity, m$_\text{CGP}$ is CGP mass, T$_\text{CGP}$ is net torque on the CGP, and I$_\text{CGP}$ is CGP moment of inertia. The term F$_\text{p}$ represents pressure gradient force and was calculated as a product of the CGP volume and pressure gradient. The CGP collision forces F$_\text{C}$ (parcel-parcel and parcel-wall collisions) were modeled according to the linear spring-dashpot model \cite{Navarro-2013}. Since the number of CGP collisions is significantly lower than the number of collisions expected in a system with distinct particles, the CGP coefficient of restitution was modified as a correction for energy dissipations during collisions. The proposed modification to the CGP coefficient of restitution made use of the kinetic theory of granular flow \cite{Lu-2014} as

\begin{equation}
    e_{CGP} = \sqrt{1 + (e_p^2 - 1) W^{1/3}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where e$_\text{CGP}$ is CGP coefficient of restitution and e$_\text{p}$ is distinct particle coefficient of restitution.

Two different drag models were used to estimate CGP drag force F$_\text{d}$ based on well-documented difference in the fluidization behavior of sand and biomass in the literature \cite{Oliveira-2013}. Drag force was estimated using the Ganser-corrected Gidaspow drag model for sand particles (bed material) and a filtered drag model for biomass particles. The Ganser correction \cite{Ganser-1993} was coupled to the Gidaspow model \cite{Gidaspow-1994} to account for non-sphericity of the sand particles as expressed below.

\begin{equation}
    \beta_{Ganser} =
    \begin{cases}
        \beta_{Ergun} & \text{if } \epsilon_g \leq 0.8 \\
        \beta_{WenYu} & \text{if } \epsilon_g > 0.8
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    \beta_{Ergun} &= 150 \frac{(1 - \epsilon_g)^2 \mu_g}{\epsilon_g d^2_{CGP} \phi^2} + 1.75 \frac{(1 - \epsilon_g) \rho_g}{\epsilon_g d_{CGP} \phi} |u_g - u_{CGP}| \\
    \beta_{WenYu} &= \frac{3}{4} C_d \frac{(1 - \epsilon_g) \rho_g}{d_{CGP} \phi} |u_g - u_{CGP}| \epsilon_g^{-2.65}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
    C_d =
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{24}{Re K_1} (1 + 0.1118(Re K_1 K_2)^{0.6567}) + \frac{0.4305 K_2}{1 + \frac{3305}{Re K_1 K_2}} & \text{if } Re < 1,000 \\
        0.44 & \text{if } Re \geq 1,000 \\
        0.0 & \text{if } Re = 0.0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    K_1 &= \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \phi^{-0.5} \right)^{-1} - 2.25 \frac{d_{CGP}}{D} \\
    K_2 &= 10^{1.8148 (-log \phi)^{0.5743}}
\end{align}

The filtered drag model (modified Sarkar drag model) used in this work for biomass particles was proposed by Gao et al. \cite{Gao-2018} and was found by the authors to have relatively high prediction strength across multiple flow regimes in fluidized bed. The modified Sarkar drag model was derived from a fine-grid simulation using the Wen-Yu drag model and can be computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    \beta_{Sarkar} = \beta_{WenYu} (1 - H_{Sakar})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    H_{Sakar} =
    \begin{cases}
        0.95 \left(1 - e^{-\alpha_1 \alpha_2 (u_{\text{slip}}^* - u_0)^p} \right) & u_{\text{slip}}^* > u_0 \\
        0.0 & u_{\text{slip}}^* \leq u_0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    u_{\text{slip}}^* = \frac{|u_g - u_{CGP}|}{u_t}
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    \alpha_1 &= \frac{\left(a_1 + a_2(1 - \epsilon_g) + a_3(1 - \epsilon_g)^2 + a_4(1 - \epsilon_g)^3 + a_5(1 - \epsilon_g)^4 \right)}{1 + e^{100 \left((1 - \epsilon_g) - 0.55 \right)}} \\
    \alpha_2 &= \left(1 + \frac{a_6}{\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*} + \frac{a_7}{(\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*)^2} \right) \left(1 + \frac{a_8}{(u_{\text{slip}}^*)^2} \right)
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
    u_0 = \frac{a_9 + a_{10} (1 - \epsilon_g)}{0.01 + (1 - \epsilon_g)^{a_{11}}} \left(1 + \frac{a_{12}}{\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*} + \frac{a_{13}}{(\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*)^2} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    p = \left(a_{14} + a_{15}(1 - \epsilon_g) + a_{16}(1 - \epsilon_g)^2 \right) \left(1 + \frac{a_{17}}{\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*} + \frac{a_{18}}{(\Delta_{\text{filter}}^*)^2} \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
    \Delta_{\text{filter}}^* &= max\left( \frac{g \Delta_{\text{filter}}}{u_t^2}, \; \frac{1}{2} \right) \\
    \Delta_{\text{filter}} &= 2 (\Delta_x \times \Delta_y \times \Delta_z)^{1/3}
\end{align}

\begin{equation}
    u_t = \frac{g d_{CGP}^2 (\rho_{CGP} - \rho_g)}{18 \mu_g}

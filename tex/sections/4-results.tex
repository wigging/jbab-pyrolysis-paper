\section{Results and discussion}

This section provides results and related discussions for the effects of different fluidization gases on the operation and conversion of a bubbling fluidized bed reactor.

\subsection{Comparison of gas properties}

Molecular weight, viscosity, density, and thermal conductivity of the individual gases investigated in this paper are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gas-properties}. The gas properties were calculated at a pressure of 101,325 Pa and a temperature of 773.15 K (500$^\circ$C). The lightest gas in terms of molecular weight and density is hydrogen while the heaviest gas is carbon dioxide. Viscosity for all the gases except hydrogen and methane ranged from 300--350 \textmugreek P. Thermal conductivity for all the gases is near 0.05 W/(m\,K) except for hydrogen which is approximately 0.35 W/(m\,K) and methane which is near 0.12 W/(m\,K).

Properties for molecular weight, viscosity, and density for the gas mixtures investigated in this paper are shown in Figure \ref{fig:mix-properties}. Similar to the individual gas properties, the mixture properties were calculated at 101,325 Pa and 773.15 K (500$^\circ$C). The fraction of each gas in the mixture is given by the values shown at the top of each column in the figure. For example, the hydrogen and nitrogen mixture is comprised of 80\% hydrogen and 20\% nitrogen which is labeled as $0.8 + 0.2$. As expected, the carbon dioxide mixture is the heaviest in terms of molecular weight and density.

\subsection{Fluidization effects}

Minimum fluidization velocity (Umf) of the bed material for the different fluidization gases is presented in Figure \ref{fig:gas-umf}. The hydrogen gas requires about twice the gas velocity to fluidize the sand bed compared to the nitrogen gas.

\subsection{Evaluation of the kinetic scheme}

The Di Blasi kinetics were put to use in a batch reactor model to investigate the time scales associated with the reaction mechanisms. Figure \ref{fig:batch-blasi} is an overview of the biomass conversion and product yields using the Di Blasi kinetics in a batch reactor at 773.15 K (500$^\circ$C). At this temperature, without the effects of secondary reactions, the kinetics offer a maximum achievable tar yield of 78\% within 5 seconds. However, if secondary reactions occur during the entire pyrolysis process then a maximum tar yield of only 53\% is possible. The Di Blasi kinetics suggest that minimizing the extent of secondary reactions is critical to producing the maximum possible tar yield.

A range of reaction temperatures were applied to the Di Blasi kinetics in the batch reactor model as shown in Figure \ref{fig:batch-blasi-temps}. The kinetics suggest that temperature has a neglible effect on primary tar yield but effects of secondary reactions are more pronounced. When secondary reactions occur during the entire pyrolysis process, maximum tar yields are realized at higher temperatures but with shorter residence times. These results suggest that if secondary reactions are minimized then temperature should not have a drastic effect on tar yield.

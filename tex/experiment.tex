\section{Experimental apparatus}

The NREL 2FBR system thermochemically converts biomass particles at fast pyrolysis conditions. The system is comprised of a bubbling fluidized bed reactor for fast pyrolysis of woody biomass particles. This reactor is referred to as the ``pyrolyzer'' in this work. An overview of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nrel-system}. Dimensions and typical operating conditions of the pyrolyzer are given in Figure \ref{fig:nrel-pyrolyzer}. More information about the NREL pyrolysis system is available elsewhere \cite{Howe-2015, Trendewicz-2015}.

\section{Experimental apparatus}

The NREL 2FBR reactor system thermochemically converts biomass feedstock at fast pyrolysis conditions. The system is comprised of two bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactors where the first reactor is for biomass fast pyrolysis and the second reactor is for vapor phase upgrading. Modeling activities discussed in this paper refer to the BFB pyrolysis reactor.

An overview of the NREL 2FBR system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:nrel-system}, components of the pyrolysis reactor are detailed in Figure \ref{fig:pyrolyzer-components}, while dimensions and typical operating conditions of the pyrolysis unit are given in Figure \ref{fig:pyrolyzer-dims-flows}. Sand is used as the dominant heat transfer medium in the pyrolyzer. Biomass particles are fed to the reactor via a screw auger and nitrogen is used as the fluidization/carrier gas. More information about the NREL 2FBR biomass pyrolysis system is available elsewhere \cite{Howe-2015, Trendewicz-2015}.
